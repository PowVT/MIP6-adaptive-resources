# MIP6: Collateral Onboarding Application

1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
    - Adaptive Resources LLC
    - Jon Ellermann

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.

Adaptive Resources aims to provide financing solutions that facilitate the responsible trade of high-value commodities for the innovation economy. Using the Adaptive web application, we seek to usher in a new era of responsible trade where the trade actors who meet sustainability standards are given preferential access to trade finance and trade contracts. The Adaptive web application focuses on a) facilitating trade finance and b) creating claims related to commodity production. The solution permanently stores trade data on the xDai blockchain in the form of an ERC721 token. The platform is being piloted in the minerals sector in Uganda (gold and tantalum) but will be applicable to all rare earth and battery metals, including cobalt, lithium, and tin.  

Individuals who create claim tokens, known as 'claim creators', will be onboarded to the platform based on a KYC and business feasibility analysis. In this context, claim creators are primarily local exporters from specific geographies where access to finance is a challenge. Pre-approved claim creators, who agree to standards of conduct and audits, will use the web application to sell their claims to downstream buyers. Buyers of the claim and auditors have the ability to view all the information related to the claims value, origin, and material properties via the web application. 

The process of buying a claim is initiated and tracked via the web app and will be used to provide controlled and risk managed tranches of pre-financing. Upon sale of the ERC721 claim token, a contract for the total value of the claim will be sent to the buyer of the claim token. The terms in the contract between the buyer and claim creator will have a predetermined payment date, typically 30 days from the invoice date. 

Prior to the 30-day deadline, the claim producers however need to pay for the commodity and for other business expenses. In the web application, claim creators with facilitated contracts can then apply for a Letter of Credit. Upon the approval of the claim documentation by the Adaptive team, a second review from our KYC partners, Adaptive will pre-finance the claim creator using xDai. At the maturity of the invoice, the claims creator will be transferred the invoiced sum from the buyer. Per the Letter of Credit, Adaptive will be paid back any pre-financing provided to the claim creator.

The underlying product value is to be used as collateral for the pre-financing to take place. For example, a regional Gold exporter creates a claim on the Adaptive app. Later, a refiner in another country buys this claim through the app. If, for example,  the underlying value of the gold on the claim is $5,000 USD, Adaptive Resources will be the temporary owners of the claim and financing will be provided to the exporter (claim creator) in order to pay the upstream supply chain workers as well as any shipping costs associated with the transaction. By using a Letter of Credit, the importer can minimize their risk while liquidity providers can be protected by the underlying collateral. By working with MakerDAO, Adaptive Resources seeks to provide pre-financing necessary for claim creators using the Letter of Credit mechanism and treating the claim itself as collateral. 

3. Provide a brief history of the project.
Co-founders have worked in minerals trade, international development, blockchain, and trade finance for years. The solution has been in conceptual development since 2019.
Development of the Adaptive web application was started in March 2021. 
Beginning in October 2021, Adaptive team members will be conducting a field test of the application at an export site in Uganda.

4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.

The pilot implementation in October will be the first procedural use of the application. 

6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.

None, the project has not been released to the public.

7. How is the applying collateral type currently used?

	Current claim creation involves paper certificates, which are usually filled in by hand and have little connection to the physical product itself. Physical records can be easily manipulated, which corrupts the due diligence process and mitigates trust in the system. Our application removes the need to rely on physical certificates of due diligence and creates a digital representation of the production claim which, due to the blockchain, cannot be manipulated and is always auditable. The current ICGLR certificate based system in place has cost millions of dollars to implement, standardize and enforce. Our solution provides an efficient method of creating accurate digital claims which can be easily audited due to the nature of blockchain transactions. This claim system enables downstream brands to contribute directly to the costs of upstream due diligence. Downstream brands buying an Adaptive ‘claim token’ do so knowing the product was produced in accordance with local environmental and labor standards.

This type of business model is accomplished by utilizing a Letter of Credit to facilitate trade finance. This type of financing allows the seller of the goods to accept a broad range of order volumes with fast processing times, enabled by the upfront financing. Using a Letter of Credit in trade finance is nothing new and popularity has increased since the pandemic due to large fluctuations in global order volumes.  When focusing on African trade, fewer banks are engaging in trade finance due to anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations. This leads to an increase in the trade finance gap which favors the large enterprises over the small and medium operations. We hope that by providing a means of financing to these types of businesses, the trade finance gap will be reduced and enable the smaller organizations to participate sustainably in the global economy. 

In previous years, a majority of the product coming from the small and medium sized mining enterprises ended up being smuggled or misrepresented in order to maximize profits while avoiding fees and taxes. This leads to a lot of products not being properly documented and unsustainably produced. This is a major headache for the downstream buyers of these products. Refiners in Europe and abroad adhere to more stringent laws which require proper due diligence when purchasing commodities coming from high risk countries/ regions. This is why our platform focuses on the documentation of these claims while also facilitating a means of finance which will support the mining infrastructure as well as the mining community that works to create the claims. We believe providing short-term trade finance is generally low risk when following proper due-diligence procedures.

8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?

Yes, the legal responsibility would lie in Adaptive Resources. Adaptive Resources LLC is a Delaware, USA company.  

9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?

Adaptive Claim tokens are created/bought/sold through the Adaptive app. Here all claim tokens are minted and sold. Financing for the Letter of Credit will be exchanged via xDai stablecoins.

10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.

Adaptive Resources adheres to the requirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.
