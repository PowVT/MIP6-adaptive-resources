# MIP6: Collateral Onboarding Application

1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
    - Adaptive Resources LLC
    - @Jon Ellermann
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.

    Adaptive Resources aims to provide incentives for responsible production and trade with the use of our Adaptive claims web application. The web application focuses on creating claims related to the mineral production and permanantly stores the data on the xDai blockchain in the form of an ERC721 token. Individuals who create these tokens are the 'claim creators'. In this context, claim creators are primarily local exporters of a specific geographical region. Pre-approved claim creators will use the web application to sell thier claims to downstream buyers. Buyers of the claim and auditors have the ability to view all the information related to the claims value, origin, and material properties via the web application. 

    The process of buying a claim is initiated and tracked via the web app. Upon sale of the ERC721 claim token, an invoice for the total value of the claim will be sent to the buyer of the claim token. The terms between the buyer and claim creator are 30 days net from the invoice date. Prior to the 30 deadline, the claim producers will need to pay the local economy for the claim/s they have produced. Here a pre-financing business model is needed. In the web application, claim creators will apply for a Letter of Credit. Upon the approval of the claim documentation by the Adaptive team, Adaptive will pre-finance the claim creator in order for the goods to be shipped in a timely manner. At the maturity of the invoice, the claims creator will be transfered the invoiced sum from the buyer. Per the Letter of Credit which was agreed upon, Adaptive will be paid back any pre-financing provided to the claim creator. 

    The underlying product value is to be used as collateral for the pre-fiancing to take place. For example, a regional Gold exporter creates a claim on the Adaptive app. Later, a refiner in another country buys this claim through the app. The underlying value of the Gold is 5,000 USD. By signing the Letter of Credit, Adaptive Resources will be the temporary owners of the claim and financing will be provided to the exporter (claim creator) in order to pay the upstream supply chain workers as well as any shipping costs associated with the transaction. By using a Letter of Credit, the importer can minimize thier risk and liquidity providers can be protected by the underlying collateral.

    In working with MakerDAO, Adaptive Resources hopes to provide the pre-financing necessary to the claim creators, using the Letter of Credit mechanism and treating the claim itself as collateral. This exposes MakerDAO and its participants to a new type of collateral, a physical one. Adaptive Resources targets ASM (Artisinal and Small-scale Mining) communities in remote regions of the world. Here 20% of the world's Gold, Tantalum, Tin, and Tungsten is mined. There is a large oppotunity to grow within the developing nations who are now more and more frequently turning to crypto for and access to financial services. 

3. Provide a brief history of the project.
    - Development of the Adaptive web application was started in March 2021. 
    - September 2021, Adaptive team members will be conducting a field test of the application at an export site in Uganda.

4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.
    - The pilot implementation in September will be the best procedual audit on the application. 

6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.
    - None

7. How is the applying collateral type currently used?
    - Currently, the Adaptive App is not being used in production. Smart contracts are finalized, but the application itself has not been released. With the help of Maker we can provide the final piece of our trade finance protocol. Ultimately, this type of claim system can be used in a variety of trade scenarios, but we hope to first focus on the precious metals industry. These metals are integral to the electric vehicle and tech sector, with demand expected to rise significantly in the coming years. Studies from the OECD have shown that metals coming out of the mines often face risk being smuggled and sold illegally in order to make higher returns on their goods. By providing a means of up front financing, the proper well documented trade route will be taken.

8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?
    - Adaptive Resources resides in the USA. 

9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?
    - Adaptive Claim tokens are created/bought/sold through the Adaptive app. Here all claim tokens are minted and sold. 
    - Financing for the Letter of Credit will be exchanged via (Dai stablecoins?)

10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.

11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.

12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.

13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.
