# MIP6: Collateral Onboarding Application

1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
    - Adaptive Resources LLC
    - @Jon Ellermann
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.
    - We have created a ERC721 token to represent mining claims for various types of materials. Mining communities in remote parts of the world need a better mechanism for documenting the products they produce as well as a marketplace where they can sell these goods to downstream buyers. 
    - The Adaptive Claim ERC721 tokens live on the xDai blockchain where the transactions are quick and cost effective. Using a the blockchain the data is immutable and can be accessed by anyone. Xdai is the native token in the Adaptive app. All Adaptive Claim tokens are purchased using xDai with the price of the claim token being proportionate to 10% of the total value of the claim. 
    - To incentivise the creation of the ERC721 'Adaptive Claim' tokens, percentages of the sale proceeds are distributed to the upstream beneficiaries who directly contributed to the creation of the claim token and the underlying physical asset. Upon downstream sale of the asset, the beneficiaries are paid out using the proceeds from the sale. Beneficiaries are the mining community that works in the mines to sustainably produce the claims. 
    - Mine sites are audited for compliance with sustainable practices which are outlined in the 'OECD - Due-Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains of Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas'. 
3. Provide a brief history of the project.
    - Development of the Adaptive web application was started in March 2021 for this project. 
    - September 2021, Adaptive team members will be conducting a field test of the application at an export site in Uganda.
4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

    - [app.adaptiveresources.io](https://adaptive-claim.surge.sh)
5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.
    - None
6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.
    - None
7. How is the applying collateral type currently used?
    - Currently, Adaptive Claim tokens are used to support the local mining communities which directly contribute to the production of the sustainably produced claims. The claim tokens are bought by downstream supply chain actors, and upon sale, the beneficiaries recieve a portion of the proceeds. These claim tokens can be purchased from anywhere around the world through the Adaptive app, which opens up various opportunities for the small scale/artisinal mining communities. 
8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?
    - Adaptive Resources resides in the USA.
    - Pilot implementation will reside at DevSol in Uganda. 
9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?
    - Adaptive Claim tokens are created/bought/sold through the Adaptive app. Here all claim tokens are minted and sold. 
10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.
11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.
12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.
13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.


## Application Notes
    - #4 asks for the source code, I am sure we dont want to give this away, but links to the smart contracts will do.
