# Collateral Application Template

1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?
    - Adaptive Resources LLC
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.
    - We have created a ERC721 token to represent mining claims for various types of materials. Mining communities in remote parts of the world need a better mechanism for documenting the products they produce as well as a marketplace where they can sell these goods to downstream buyers. 
    - The ERC721 tokens links the physical product to the xDai blockchain. Using the blockchain the data is immutable and can be accessed by anyone. 
    - To incentivise the creation of the ERC721 'Adaptive Claim' tokens, percentages of the sale proceeds are distributed to the upstream beneficiaries who directly contributed to the creation of the claim token and the underlying physical asset. Upon downstream sale of the asset, the beneficiaries are paid out using the proceeds from the sale.
3. Provide a brief history of the project.
    - Development of the Adaptive web application was started in March 2021 for this project. 
4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.
5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.
    - None
6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.
7. How is the applying collateral type currently used?
8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?
9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?
10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.
11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.
12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.
13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.
